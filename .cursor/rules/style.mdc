Follow standard Go conventions (gofmt).
Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
Add comments to explain complex logic. If the code is self-explained, do not add obvious comment.
Keep functions small and focused on a single task. Break down function if it is complex.
Handle errors explicitly; do not ignore them.
Use dependency injection to decouple components.
